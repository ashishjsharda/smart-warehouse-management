## Overview

Welcome to the **Smart Warehouse Management System** project! This open-source initiative aims to revolutionize warehouse operations through the integration of cutting-edge AI and robotics technologies. Our goal is to create an efficient, accurate, and fully automated warehouse management system.

## Project Goals

- **Inventory Tracking**: Implement AI to monitor and manage real-time inventory levels.
- **Order Fulfillment**: Optimize picking and packing processes using intelligent algorithms and robotics.
- **Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)**: Utilize robots to efficiently move goods within the warehouse.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Use NLP to handle user queries and generate insightful reports.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Rust with Actix-web
- **Databases**: 
  - Vector DB: Pinecone or Milvus
  - Relational DB: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Messaging System**: Apache Kafka
- **Robotics**: ROS (Robot Operating System)
- **NLP**: OpenAI GPT-4 or Hugging Face Transformers
